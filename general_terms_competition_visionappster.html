                                If, at any time, any provision of these Terms is deemed by a court of competent jurisdiction to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable in any respect, the legality, validity or enforceability of the remaining provisions shall in no way be affected or impaired thereby.

                            <p>
                                A failure to exercise, or any delay in exercising, on the part of either party, any right or remedy hereunder shall neither operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right or remedy prevent any further or other exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or remedy.
                            </p>
