After that VisionAppster will give the price for the thousand (1000) API requests.

              When purchasing a Component from VisionAppster Store, the User has from one to three license options to choose from depending on the Seller's choice of licensing options under which the Seller has chosen to make its Component available. The possible licenses are following: <br><br>
              1) Per seat license;<br>
              2) Monthly subscription license; and<br>
              3) Usage based license.

            <p><strong>All sales made at VisionAppster Store are final and non-refundable, unless otherwise required by applicable law.</strong>
            </p>

            <p>User is allowed to sublicense the original Seller's Component as a part of its Integrated Component with the license options the original Seller has provided its original Component.

              Purchasing a Monthly subscription license means that the User purchases a license to use the Component for one month.

              When User purchases Usage based license on the Store, the User shall determine the amount of Cloud Balance that the User is willing to purchase. That Cloud Balance is used to pay API requests made related to the Component(s) that the User has chosen so that only the usage shall be billed. The price of the specific Component's API requests consist of the license fee determined by the Seller including the VisionAppster Cloud Engine Service fee.<br><br>

              To be able to use Components under the Usage based license, User must have enough Cloud Balance on its Cloud account. The purchased Cloud Balance is not allocated for a specific Component's API requests, but it can be used for multiple Components' Usage based licenses. <br><br>

              User can top up its Cloud Balance anytime to ensure the functionality of the Usage based licenses chosen. User shall set a notice threshold for its Cloud Balance in EUR. VisionAppster will notice the User if the Cloud Balance reaches the notice threshold set. <br><br>

            <p>The reason for this is that it is almost impossible to guarantee the rights of the Seller with respect to the Components licensed and returned.
