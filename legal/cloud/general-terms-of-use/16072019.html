User may not sublicense or transfer any rights granted herein except as explicitly permitted under these Terms.
              </p>


              <h5>4 &nbsp; VISIONAPPSTER CLOUD FEATURES</h5>
              <p>
                VisionAppster Cloud constitutes certain Features and Services available to various user categories.
              </p>


              <p>
                Unless otherwise agreed with the User in the electronic order form or otherwise, VisionAppster Cloud includes following Features, being Standard Features of their nature, which the User may utilize upon registering to VisionAppster Cloud, creating VisionAppster account and by accepting these Terms and other service specific terms, as may be applicable. Availability of different Features and possible costs thereof shall be subject to User's subscription and Tier, as further described in User Manual.
              </p>



              <p style="margin-left:5%; "> <b>1. Selling</b> <br><br>
                Regarding certain features and services available in the VisionAppster Cloud, the Seller may upload its Components (software code including any associated documentation) which it has developed by using VisionAppster Builder into the VisionAppster Cloud. Subject to acceptance of separate agreement between VisionAppster and the Seller, the Seller may provide its application and make it publicly available to be licensed/bought by other users in the Store by using the VisionAppster Cloud as a platform for transaction executed between the User and other users. Seller may also purchase other Sellers' Components available in the Store and integrate them part of its own Component and in that way make an Integrated Component as further described in the VisionAppster Store Seller Agreement. Further terms are set forth in separate agreement between VisionAppster and the Seller.

              </p>


              <p style="margin-left:5%; "> <b>2. Purchase</b><br><br>
                Subject to acceptance of applicable end user license agreement provided by Seller, the User may purchase different Components in Store. VisionAppster acts as Seller's agent and is the merchant of record meaning that VisionAppster acts on behalf of the Seller, but the Components are displayed and licensed at the Store by Sellers. Components may be integrated meaning that the Seller's Component may include also other User's Component(s) and made available as an Integrated Component to Users upon ordering process between Seller and User.<br><br>

                Particular purchase made in the Store may also be subject to Sellers' guidelines, policies, terms of use and end user license agreement applicable to such purchase. If the Component in question is integrated, the User shall accept any applicable end user license terms which each Seller has made available in the Store. Such guidelines, policies and terms of use shall be applied together with these Terms. In the event of any inconsistency between these Terms and VisionAppster Store Component Seller's Terms, the VisionAppster Store Component Seller's Terms shall prevail. <br><br>

                User understands and agrees that VisionAppster acts as Seller's agent and on behalf of the Seller, and thus VisionAppster is not a party to the sales agreement or end user license agreement between the User and the Seller. VisionAppster is neither a seller, developer, builder nor owner of Components available in the Store, unless VisionAppster decides to provide its own Components for licensing in the Store. The Sellers may provide their own license agreements or other purchase agreements or other guidance to the Users, subject to User's approval prior to purchase of particular Component.<br><br>

                As the merchant of record VisionAppster charges the User for any VisionAppster Purchase transaction, including any applicable value added, sales, goods and services or other taxes that VisionAppster is obliged to collect and will remit the applicable amount to the Seller(s) of the Component in question.<br><br>

                The Sellers are solely responsible for determining the license fees or any other prices for each Component, and VisionAppster has no power of decision regarding any Component license fees. Fees shall be charged in accordance with Clause 12. The Sellers have sole power of governance regarding any Components, their features, prices and terms of license.

              </p>

This Service may be free-of-charge or subject to separate fee, as further described in User Manual and/or service-specific site.
              </p>



              <p style="margin-left:5%; "> <b>4. Engine</b><br><br>

This Service may be free-of-charge or subject to separate fee depending on the User's Tier, as further described in User Manual and/or service-specific site. VisionAppster's role with respect to Cloud Engine is limited to provision of Cloud Engine infrastructure. The User is liable for any use and provision of Components and/or services using Cloud Engine for other Users in the Store.
              </p>

              <p style="margin-left:5%; "> <b>5. Online Viewer</b><br><br>

              <p>In addition to Standard Features, the VisionAppster Cloud may include certain Additional Features, which are subject to acceptance of separate terms and conditions and subject to separate fee.

              </p>

              <p>VisionAppster retains the right to modify, add to or delete the Features. In the event that any modifications, additions, or deletions require changes in the User's services VisionAppster shall notify the User as quickly as possible.

              <h6>12.1 Fees </h6>

              <p>Services and Features available in VisionAppster Cloud may be free of charge or subject to separate fee. Possible fees are set forth on the service specific site and in User Manual. VisionAppster may increase, modify or add new fees and charges for any of the services and/or Features from time to time by informing of such changes in the VisionAppster Cloud with a period of notice of at least thirty (30) days.

Any and all purchases made in different VisionAppster Services such as VisionAppster Store are non-refundable and final, unless otherwise required by applicable law. <br><br>

                As regards certain services or Features, the fees and charges are only estimates based on assumptions. As regards such estimates, User shall be fully responsible for the accruing actual fees and charges.<br><br>

                All technical advice, consultation or other product or Service not specifically included in the prices is deemed to be Additional Feature and/or Service and subject to separate fees charged by VisionAppster. <br><br>

                Prices set forth on VisionAppster service sites are exclusive of any applicable value added or other corresponding indirect taxes and payment processing fee. If VisionAppster is obliged to collect applicable taxes such as VAT, VisionAppster shall add the applicable tax to the service fee or other price. The payment processing fee that VisionAppster shall add to the price, will be calculcated based on the transaction price (including taxes, if applicable). At payment moment, the payable sum that will be shown to the User is inclusive of payment processing fee and all applicable taxes that VisionAppster is obliged to collect. Hence, at the payment moment the User sees the total price.
