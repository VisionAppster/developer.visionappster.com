With the Selling feature, the Seller may upload its Components into the VisionAppster Cloud (software code including any associated documentation) which it has developed by using VisionAppster Builder. Subject to acceptance of separate agreement between VisionAppster and the Seller and paying an annual Seller account fee of ninety-nine (99) euros, the Seller gets access to VisionAppster Store's Selling features and may provide its Component and make it publicly available to be licensed by other users on the Store by using the VisionAppster Cloud as a platform for transaction executed between the Seller and other users. The Seller may also purchase other Sellers' Components available in the Store and create new Components in which are integrated other Users' Components. </p>

                                <p>Components may be integrated meaning that the Seller's Component may include also other User's Component(s) and is made available as an Integrated Component to Users upon ordering process between Seller and User. In the event of uploading an Integrated Component, the Seller shall enter any relevant information, such as related components, related dependencies and related product images. The version and price of an Integrated Component will be frozen at the time of uploading it into the Store, in order to verify the division of payments between the Seller and other Users whose Components are included in the Integrated Component.

                                <p>Components that the Seller has uploaded and made available in the Store free of charge, the Seller may not in future collect any license fees for those Component copies that have been purchased free of charge earlier. If Seller chooses to change its Component from free of charge to subject of a license fee, the Seller is obliged to upload a new version of the Component to the Store.

No later than forty-five (45) days following the end of each monthly period, VisionAppster makes available to the Seller on its VisionAppster Cloud account a sales report in sufficient detail to permit the Seller to identify the Components sold in that monthly period and the total amount to be remitted to the Seller by VisionAppster.
