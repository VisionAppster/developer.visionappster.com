              <p>Any upload of a Seller Material to the Store by the Seller shall be deemed as a grant of license to respective Component or Integrated Component according to this Section. THE SELLER ACKNOWLEDGES AND ACCEPTS THAT AS SELLER OF COMPONENT, THE OTHER SELLERS OF THEIR OWN COMPONENTS IN THE STORE ARE ENTITLED TO INTEGRATE AND RESELL THE SELLER'S COMPONENT AS A PART OF THEIR INTEGRATED PRODUCTS. <br><br>

                The Seller acknowledges that VisionAppster has no control over the use of Components and/or Integrated Components after they have been licensed to Licensees.<br><br>

                By using the Store, the Seller commits to include following terms set forth in Sections 11.1, 11.2 and 11.3 in the applicable EULA.<br><br>

                The Seller may use the VisionAppster EULA, which is attached to the VisionAppster Cloud General Terms of Use. Seller may also choose to use its own EULA for any Component the Seller makes available in the Store, provided however that the Seller's EULA must include and may not be inconsistent with the minimum terms and conditions specified on VisionAppster EULA. Additionally, Seller's EULA must comply with all applicable laws in all countries where the Seller wishes VisionAppster to allow other Users to acquire a license for the Component. <br><br>

                Users can review any applicable EULA that the Seller chooses to provide instead of the VisionAppster EULA at the time User is purchasing the license for the Component. VisionAppster shall then notify the Licensee that Licensee's use of the Component in question is subject to the terms and conditions of the Seller's EULA. <br><br>

                The Seller acknowledges that the EULA for the Component that the Seller has decided to make available in the Store is solely between the Seller and the Licensee and VisionAppster shall not be responsible for, and shall not have any liability whatsoever under, any EULA or any breach by the Seller or any Licensee of any of the terms and conditions of any EULA.

              </p>


              <h6>11.1 Components </h6>

              <p><u>Validity of Licenses</u><br><br>

                Generally the licenses for different Components are valid within the major version number of the purchase moment. If the Seller changes the major version number, the Licensee shall purchase new license for that version or continue to use the previously purchased version.<br><br>

                Monthly subscription licenses remain in force for the duration on initial subscription period, and thereafter renews automatically, unless terminated by User in the User's VisionAppster Cloud account forty-eight (48) hours before the renewal of the subscription period. Per seat licenses are valid permanently for the seat that the license is purchased. Usage based licenses remain in force for three hundred sixty-five (365) days from the purchasing date. After the User has used the amount of API Requests that the User has purchased, the API for the Component in question finishes from operating and the User shall purchase more requests if the User is willing to continue to use the Component under the Usage based license.<br><br>

                <u>Reproduction and Implementation</u><br><br>

                The Seller hereby grants to the Licensee and Licensee hereby accepts, a worldwide, non-exclusive, non-transferable license, for the terms of applicable EULA, to make copies of the Component for the purposes to use as such, or as standalone component, or to be incorporated in other Component for purposes of creating Integrated Component as defined in Section 11.2. The Licensee is entitled to take agreed measures in order to implement the Component to the compatible operating environment.<br><br>

                The Seller grants to the Licensee a restricted, non-exclusive and non-transferable license to use the Components in connection with hardware, software and/or VisionAppster Cloud indicated and solely in compliance with the Seller Material. <br><br>

                <u>Right to Sublicense and right to use as a service</u><br><br>

                Seller grants to the Licensee a worldwide, non-exclusive, non-transferable right to sublicense, for the terms of applicable EULA, only to end users who have no right to distribute or sub-license or otherwise transfer or assign the Components sublicensed to end users. However, sublicensing is permitted, provided that (i) the Seller's (and in case of Integrated Components, also the original Seller's) Component is available at the Store; and (ii) the Seller (and in case of Integrated Components, also the original Seller) receives full payment from each license transaction.<br><br>

                Licensee shall be granted a worldwide, non-exclusive, non-transferable right to use the Component as a part of its service provisioning (SaaS service), provided however that such right to offer is valid only to end users who have no right to distribute or sublicense or otherwise transfer or assign the Components sublicensed to end users. However, sub-licensing is permitted, provided that (i) the Seller's (and in case of Integrated Components, also the original Seller's) Component is available at the Store; and (ii) the Seller (and in case of Integrated Components, also the original Seller) receives full payment from each license transaction.

              </p>

              <h6>11.2 Right to Resell Integrated Components</h6>

              <p>In addition to the above license, a User is entitled to resell / license any Component uploaded by the original Seller in the Store as part of its own Components (Integrated Components). <br><br>

                If the User licenses original Seller's Component as a part of Integrated Components in his/her own name and for his/her own account, the User acts as independent trader as regards both the original Seller of such Component and end users. <br><br>

                When licensing Integrated Components, the User agrees:</p>

              <p style="margin-left:5%; ">(i) to integrate original Seller's Components (User may modify Components that are not encrypted/protected, but shall not reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble Components, expect and only to the extent that such activity is expressly permitted under mandatory statutory applicable law.) to its own Component for purpose of creating the Integrated Component to be offered to end users on its own account without any risk or liability to original Seller;<br><br>

                (ii) to purchase and pay applicable licenses to Components from the original Seller and resell such licenses to end users;<br><br>

                (iii) that with respect of liability issues, the Seller of Integrated Components carries all risks and liabilities with respect of the Component and Integrated Component towards the Licensee(s) and VisionAppster shall not be liable for the use of any Component or Integrated Component in any manner whatsoever;
              </p>

              <p>The User undertakes to pay for the Seller as a sole compensation an agreed Component license fee per each Integrated Component which User resells to its end customers. <br><br>

                The User understands that if the original Seller wants to remove a Component from the Store, such Component will be removed from the Store's Component selection within a time period of sixty (60) days (VisionAppster will, however, keep a copy of such Component for administrative purposes). Despite the removal, license to Component granted before removal will remain at the use of the Licensee for the purpose of being integrated as part of Integrated Component for one hundred eighty (180) days after the Component has been removed from the Store's Component selection.<br><br>

                The User understands and agrees that by integrating a Component as part of its Components and by reselling it as Integrated Component, the User shall be solely liable for the Seller for any use thereof. The User shall be solely liable to make sure that the Integrated Component does not infringe any third-party rights. VisionAppster shall have no liability of Integrated Components.<br><br>

                <u>Limitations</u> <br><br>

                Licensee undertakes specifically not to perform any of the acts referred to in this subsection: (i) reverse engineer, disassemble, or decompile the Component or any part thereof, except when, and to the extent, such restriction is expressly prohibited by applicable mandatory laws; (ii) remove, alter, or deface any copyright indication or other notices of any proprietary rights or IPR from the Component; (iii) otherwise distribute, sublicense or transfer the Component to any third party except as authorized herein with respect to Integrated Components. There are no implied licenses, unless specified otherwise in these Terms.<br><br>

                The Seller shall not (i) have a right to deny the production or use of Integrated Component; (ii) be entitled to prevent the promoting, marketing, or any other measures aiming to make Integrated Component available to end users; (iii) restrict other User's rights use the Component as part of Integrated Component by setting additional or exceptional conditions or taking suchlike technical measures; (iv) regarding Components already sold in the Store, cancel Licensee's right to use the Component as granted herein, including Licensee's right to resell any Component as part of its Components as Integrated Components or offer as a service; or (v) set such legal conditions or technical restraints, which would make it legally impossible to use the license as granted herein.

                <h5> 12 &nbsp; PRICING AND COMMISSIONS </h5>

                <p>Seller may choose to upload its Component to be made available free of charge or for a license fee. Seller may set the Price for license (excluding applicable value added, sales, goods and services or other similar indirect taxes, Cloud Engine service fee and payment processing fee) to Components in euros (EUR). The price of a Component license shall be at least five (5) euros due administrative expenses. To the Price set by the Seller will VisionAppster add applicable Cloud Engine service fee, payment processing fee and taxes. If the Seller chooses to distribute its Component with a Usage based license, VisionAppster will add its Cloud Engine service fee to the Price the Seller has set for the license. The Prices set under this Section will determine the amount of funds Seller will receive. As Seller's agent, VisionAppster collects all Prices payable by Licensees for Components acquired by those Licensees, as further set forth herein. <br><br>

                  If VisionAppster is obliged to collect applicable taxes such as VAT, VisionAppster shall add the applicable tax to the service fee so that VisionAppster receives the full amount of its service fee with respect to the Component in question. From the Price payable by the Licensee (excluding indirect taxes collected by VisionAppster) shall be deducted first all applicable administrative fees (included but not limited to payment processing fee, Cloud Engine service fee, possible refunds etc.). From the residual net Price will VisionAppster withhold thirty (30) per cent as a service fee and the remaining seventy (70) will be remitted to the Seller. <br><br>

                  If Seller is willing to change the Price of its monthly subscription license, the previous Price set by the Seller shall remain in force for six (6) months after the month when the Seller makes the change for the licenses that are purchased before the change of the Price. After that the Licensee shall decide if it wants to continue to purchase the license with the new Price or stop purchasing the subscription. <br><br>

                  If Seller chooses to distribute its Component free of charge, VisionAppster shall not be granted the aforementioned service fee of thirty (30) percent but VisionAppster will charge the Cloud Engine Service fees as set forth in service specific site and User Manual if the Seller has chosen to make its Component available under Usage based license. Components that the Seller has uploaded and made available in the Store free of charge, the Seller may not in future collect any license fees for those Component copies that have been purchased free of charge earlier. If Seller chooses to change its Component from free of charge to subject of a license fee, the Seller is obliged to upload a new version of the Component to the Store.<br><br>

                  Without limitation of the foregoing where a refund is provided by VisionAppster on Seller's behalf under these Terms, may VisionAppster withhold Seller's share of the refund amount from future Transactions of the Seller or from Seller's current balance. As described earlier in these Terms, the Seller's Component may be incorporated from one or more other Sellers' Components and in such event the Seller will receive its funds pro rata.<br><br>

                  Upon collection of any amounts from any Licensee as the Price for any Component delivered to that Licensee hereunder, VisionAppster shall deduct the full amount of its service fee with respect to that Component, and any taxes collected by VisionAppster under clause 13 hereof, and shall remit to the Seller, the rest of those Prices in accordance with VisionAppster's standard business practices, including the following: remittance payments (i) are made to Seller's PayPal account; (ii) require Seller to provide necessary information related to remittance on the Seller's VisionAppster Cloud account; and (iii) subject to the foregoing requirements, will be made no later than forty-five (45) days following the end of the monthly period in which the amount in question was received by VisionAppster from the Licensee. No later than forty-five (45) days following the end of each monthly period, VisionAppster makes available to the Seller on its VisionAppster Cloud account a sales report in sufficient detail to permit the Seller to identify the Components sold in that monthly period and the total amount to be remitted to the Seller by VisionAppster.<br><br>

                  All sales made at VisionAppster Store are final and non-refundable, unless otherwise required by applicable law. Terms and conditions concerning refunds on Components, that are licensed from the Store, are the third-party payment processor's standard terms and conditions. In the event that a Licensee returns a Component and/or receives a refund, all rights granted herein and under the applicable EULA terminate and the Licensee is obliged to destroy any and all copies of the Component or accessory material under the control or possession of the Licensee.

                </p>

                <h5>13 &nbsp; TAXATION</h5>

                <p>In the event that the sale of any of the Components to any Licensee is subject to any value added, sales, use, goods and services, or other similar tax or levy, under applicable law, responsibility for the collection and remittance of that tax for sales of the Components to Licensees will be determined in accordance with User Manual. If any Price payable by any Licensee for any of the Component is subject to (i) any withholding or similar tax; or (ii) any value added, sales, use, goods and services, or other tax or levy not collected by VisionAppster hereof; or (iii) any other tax or other government levy of whatever nature, the full amount of that tax or levy shall be solely for Seller's account, and shall not reduce the service fee to which VisionAppster is entitled with respect to these Terms.<br><br>

                  Should VisionAppster reasonably believe that such tax is due, VisionAppster will deduct the full amount of such withholding or similar tax from the gross amount owed to Seller, and will remit the full amount withheld to the competent tax authorities. <br><br>

                  VisionAppster shall be entitled and Seller obliged to provide all information, including but not limited to any needed certification or documentation needed for the tax authorities to account for performance of Seller's obligations. Without limitation of any other remedies under these Terms or at law, any Seller's failure to provide aforementioned information or documentation will be considered as basis for VisionAppster to suspend payment to Seller under these Terms indefinitely until provision of such information or documentation. Suspended payment shall not accrue or be entitled to any interest of any kind.<br><br>

                  Seller agrees that it has sole responsibility and liability for any actions related to Seller's Taxes or other applicable duties set forth in this paragraph. VisionAppster may provide means for collecting and paying the aforementioned Taxes and other applicable duties but the Seller agrees that VisionAppster shall not have any liability for providing these means and if VisionAppster shall provide these means, it shall not relieve the Seller of its obligations. Seller shall indemnify and hold VisionAppster harmless against any and all claims by any tax authority for any underpayment of any value added, sales, goods and services, use or other tax or levy, and any penalties and/or interest thereon.
