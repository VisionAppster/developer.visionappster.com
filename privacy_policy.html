                                <p>
                                    The purposes of processing the personal data are the basic operation of VisionAppster’s services, including user support operations, service maintenance and technical support, responding to inquiries, organizing competitions, collecting statistics regarding service usage, and conducting scientific and market research.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    VisionAppster may also use your information for the purposes of creating, administering and troubleshooting accounts, for invoicing, user account management, statistics and development purposes. Data may be used to enable user-to-user communication (e.g. via Development Forum) and to inform users of new products and services, including promotional offers. Personal data may be used to inform of VisionAppster services, such as sending a newsletter or informing about email campaigns or other ways of maintaining the customer relationship.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    VisionAppster may use your information to prevent fraud, enforce the relevant terms of service or licenses, and protect users.
                                </p>


                                <p>
                                    As part of data processing the data may be used for profiling purposes and to perform analytics and research aimed at improving the accuracy, effectiveness, usability, or popularity of products and services that VisionAppster provides.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    VisionAppster may collect date of birth or personal / business ID, billing or financial account information and tax ID or other similar information for the purposes of 1) providing the VisionAppster Services for Users; and 2) paying a competition participant(s) or winner(s) an awarded prize, subject to competition rules.

                                    The legal justification for processing personal data is fulfilling the contract between the parties or the legitimate interest of the controller, which is based on the relationship between the parties. The legal justification may also be the data subject consent, if the applicable legislation so requires.
                                </p>

                                <p>You are not required to provide the personal information that we have requested, but, not providing the requested personal information may in many cases means that we will not be able to provide you with our products or services or respond to your queries.</p>

                                <p>In certain transactions, such as in VisionAppster Store where VisionAppster only provides the Store and transfer of payments by VisionAppster or third-party payment processor as further described in Store Seller’s terms, VisionAppster is in the role of data processor. In such events the data controller such as the seller is responsible for ensuring that it has the necessary rights and has acquired the necessary consents to process personal data. The Seller maintains privacy policy records as required by the data protection legislation. </p>

                                <p>
                                    Personal data may be processed by authorized third parties, who process the data on behalf of VisionAppster for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy (for instance, third-party service providers of technical infrastructure or services).
