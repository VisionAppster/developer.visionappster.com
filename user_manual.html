                                    Cloud Engine service provided by VisionAppster is charged per one thousand (1000) API requests. In this purpose API request means every call that the application or other software makes to VisionAppster's Cloud Engine server. When the User uploads its Component to its Cloud account, VisionAppster will test the Component with a photo set to know the stress that the Component puts the Cloud Engine server under. After that VisionAppster will give the price for the thousand (1000) API requests. If the Component in question does not have a cropping feature in it, the User shall accept a floating price model for the usage of Cloud Engine. In that case the price will be based on the last thousand (1000) requests made for the Cloud Engine server.</p>

                                <p> To be able to use the Cloud Engine service, the User shall top up its Cloud Balance and set a notification threshold in EUR for the Cloud Balance. VisionAppster will notify the User when the Cloud Balance reaches the threshold. If the Cloud Balance runs out, the Cloud Engine service stops from working.

The price of the specific Component's API requests consist of the license fee determined by the Seller including the VisionAppster Cloud Engine Service fee.<br><br>
